Built a system to predict the price of a property based on its properties like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, city etc..

● Normalizing data: Created a normalized database from the raw data file and loaded the data into SQLite3.
● Data Preprocessing: Removing unwanted data and imputing. Created profile report for training data analysis. Implemented one-hot encoding for categorical values. Utilized seaborn and matplotlib for creating plots.
● Model Training and Optimization: Trained models like Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision tree, Random forest etc.. Registered all experiments and models in MLFlow on Dagshub. Performed PCA to generate new features.
● Model Deployment: Choose the best model and created a Docker image for deployment on Digital Ocean.
● Streamlit app: Developed a Streamlit app that interfaces with the deployed model.Built a system to predict the price of a property based on its properties like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, city etc.. ● Normalizing data: Created a normalized database from the raw data file and loaded the data into SQLite3. ● Data Preprocessing: Removing unwanted data and imputing.
